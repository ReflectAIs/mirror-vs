# Change Log

All notable changes to the "Mirror VS" extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-07-18

### Added
- **Structured Agent Memory Output**: Agent memory service now returns memories as structured JSON (`getPersistentMemoryObject()`) with categorized lists (conventions, architectureDecisions, knownPatterns, userPreferences, notes) for clearer LLM consumption.
- **Contextual Memory Goal**: `getContextString()` now accepts an optional `currentGoal` parameter, injecting it into memory context so the agent can align its behavior with the user's current objective.
- **Streaming Suppression for Tool Loops**: `agent-completer.ts` now suppresses intermediate streaming chunks for subsequent tool-loop turns (when `isSubsequent=true`), reducing UI noise. Pure conversational replies without tool calls are still emitted to the sidebar.

### Changed
- **System Prompt Architecture (v2)**: Refactored `baseAgentRole.ts` to produce a streamlined, principle-driven prompt with three pillars — Maximum Information Gain, Read-Before-Patch Grounding, Diagnostics-Driven Repair, and Call-Hierarchy Safety — replacing the verbose numbered rule list.
- **Control Loop Guard Improvements**: Added comprehensive test coverage for `list_dir` validation, ensuring standard workspace directories are permitted with appropriate warnings.

### Fixed
- **Cross-Platform Path Handling**: All `fs` mocks in `orchestrator.test.ts` now normalize paths with `.replace(/\\/g, '/')` to resolve Windows backslash mismatches in test assertions.

## [0.3.2] - 2025-07-18

### Added
- **Tool Result Eviction Service**: New `tool-result-eviction.ts` service that intelligently evicts low-value tool results (read_file, grep_search, semantic_search output) from the conversation history when context is tight, keeping only high-signal content like patches and errors.
- **Git Tools Test Suite**: Comprehensive test suite for `git-tools.ts` covering diff, log, status, and commit operations.

### Changed
- **Embedding Service Chunking**: Document embedding now processes files in 50-line chunks with 5-line overlap, producing finer-grained search results with line-numbered file paths for more precise semantic retrieval.
- **Context Compaction Threshold**: Lowered compaction trigger from 65% to 50% of context window for leaner history with earlier summarization.
- **Default Tool Output Limit**: Reduced `maxToolOutputLength` from 20,000 to 8,000 characters to keep context in check.
- **System Prompt Architecture**: Split the monolithic `buildSystemPrompt` into `buildStaticSystemPromptCore` (cached, rarely-changing content) and `buildDynamicSystemPrompt` (per-turn context), improving token efficiency by ~4–8K tokens per turn.

### Fixed
- **Removed Stale Architecture Constraint Lock**: Cleaned up dead code in `control-loop-guard.ts` that checked `SEARCH_SCOPE_BLOCKED` against tool paths — this logic was unused and added unnecessary warning noise.
- **Security Hardening**: Removed `turns.txt` (conversation log with potential sensitive data) from git tracking; excluded source maps from VSIX package; added `dist/*.js.map`, `turns.txt`, and `*.js.map` to `.gitignore`/`.vscodeignore`.

## [0.3.1] - 2025-07-17

### Added
- **Worked Accordion UI**: Tool cards are now grouped into a collapsible "Worked" accordion per turn, with a live elapsed timer, a spinning indicator during execution, and auto-collapse on completion/error.
- **Line-Targeted Patch Format**: Updated `patch_file` and `multi_patch_file` tool specifications to prioritize structured line-range attributes (`start_line`, `end_line`, `expected_search_content`, `replace_content`) over the legacy SEARCH/REPLACE block format.
- **Input Tabs Bar**: Added a tabs bar above the chat input with categorized action buttons (Review, Chat, etc.) for quick access.

### Fixed
- **Publisher Namespace Verification**: Changed `publisher` field in `package.json` from `"DIPESHMAJITHIA"` (all-caps) to `"DipeshMajithia"` (PascalCase) to match the registered VS Code Marketplace / Open VSX namespace, eliminating the "not a verified publisher" warning on extension install.
- **Robust Patch Matching**: Added `findFuzzyMatchRange` and `normalizeLineExact` fallback logic in `file-tools.ts` for both `patch_file` and `multi_patch_file`. When a line-range match fails exactly, the system now searches a ±15 line neighborhood and performs fuzzy content matching before throwing an error.
- **History Tool Card Accordion**: Tool card history is now rendered inside a collapsible accordion container with a card count badge instead of inline in the chat.

### Changed
- **Tool Specifications Prompt** (`toolSpecifications.ts`): Updated tool usage instructions to emphasize the line-targeted format, with the legacy SEARCH/REPLACE block format as a secondary fallback. Added detailed examples for both `patch_file` and `multi_patch_file`.
- **Tool Status Rendering** (`05-message-handlers.js`, `sidebar.js`): Tool status updates (running/success/error) now target the worked accordion content container instead of the top-level `chatMessages` container.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-07-17

### Added
- **Mirror VS Runtime v1.0 (Phase 1-4)**: Ground-up architecture overhaul adding a production-grade agent execution runtime with 17 new modules:
  - runtime/state-graph.ts - Formal ExecutionState machine (Planning, Scheduling, Reasoning, Executing, Verifying, Recovery) with transition listeners
  - runtime/task-queue.ts - Hierarchical task decomposition with parent-child relationship tracking and queuing
  - runtime/context-store.ts - In-memory context store with add/remove/get operations for virtual page caching
  - runtime/action-request.ts - Structured tool call parsing with name, args, and metadata extraction
  - runtime/loop-detector.ts - Agent loop stucking detection based on repeated tool calls or identical argument patterns
  - runtime/explorer-mode.ts - Explorer mode management with adaptive search budget scaling based on file structure complexity
  - runtime/confidence-engine.ts - Turn-level self-assessment scoring (0-1) with recovery triggers at configurable thresholds
  - runtime/job-manager.ts - Job lifecycle management with tracking of tool execution jobs, their outputs, and statuses
  - runtime/recovery-engine.ts - Automatic recovery strategies on failure: retry, escalate, skip, or fallback
  - runtime/verification-pipeline.ts - Multi-stage verification pipeline: syntax, typecheck, build, test with per-stage pass/fail tracking
  - runtime/ast-parser.ts - Lightweight AST analysis supporting import detection and symbol extraction
  - runtime/knowledge-graph.ts - Directed graph of code entities (files, symbols, dependencies) for smarter code navigation
  - runtime/multi-agent.ts - Multi-agent coordination with Planner, Executor, Reviewer role delegation and message passing
  - runtime/learning-engine.ts - Session-based learning that tracks successful patterns and avoids repeated mistakes
  - runtime/workspace-adapters.ts - Workspace type detection (Node.js, React, generic) with adapter-specific tool availability
  - runtime/types.ts - Shared ExecutionState enum, Task interface, and ContextItem interface
- **Context Store + Virtual Page Cache**: _resolveFileRefs() now writes file references as [File Cache: path] placeholders, resolved to full content (or diffs for unchanged files) via _resolveCachePlaceholders() with eviction tracking
- **CONVERSATIONAL TaskMode**: New state-machine.ts mode automatically detected for greetings, casual queries, and short non-actionable inputs (<5 words with no action verbs) - avoids unnecessary tool execution
- **Dependency-Boosted RAG Search**: search-tools.ts now boosts semantic search results by 5% per dependent file, sorted by combined relevance score
- **Extended Event Bus**: event-bus.ts now supports 6 new event types: FilePatched, DiagnosticsUpdated, JobCompleted, WorkspaceChanged, UserInterrupted, VerificationPassed
- **Runtime Test Suite**: 18 new tests across 3 test files covering StateGraph transitions, TaskQueue scheduling, ContextStore operations, MultiAgent message passing, RecoveryEngine strategies, AST parsing, and KnowledgeGraph indexing

### Changed
- **Version**: 0.2.15 to 0.3.0 (major milestone - production-grade agent runtime)
- **Orchestrator Architecture**: Integrated 15+ runtime modules into AgentOrchestrator; agent loop now leverages StateGraph for state transitions and VerificationPipeline for post-patch verification
- **File Reference Resolution**: Changed from inline full-content expansion to two-pass system: pass 1 writes [File Cache: ...] placeholder, pass 2 resolves via _resolveCachePlaceholders() using ContextStore items (supports unchanged, diff, and evicted states)

## [0.2.15] - 2025-07-17

### Fixed
- **Screenshot Base64 Extraction**: Fixed regex mismatches in orchestrator.ts where screenshot base64 data was not being extracted and forwarded to the vision model. Both the display-result cleaning regex and the image-extraction pipeline regex were matching an outdated return format from browser-tools.ts, causing match[1] to be undefined and the vision model to never receive screenshot data.
- **Fuzzy Patch Robustness**: Improved normalizeLineFuzzy() in file-tools.ts to strip backslash characters before comparison, preventing false mismatches when SEARCH blocks contain escaped special characters. Includes new test case verifying fuzzy patch success with backslash-containing content.

## [0.2.14] - 2025-07-17

### Added
- **🏗️ Orchestrator Modularization**: Decomposed the ~1800-line `orchestrator.ts` monolith into focused, testable modules:
  - `state-machine.ts` — `AgentState`/`TaskMode` enums, `determineTaskMode()`, `detectActiveSymptom()`, `canDescribePatch()`, `hasSufficientJSEvidence()`, `isErrorDirectlyLocalized()`, `hasEnoughInformationForReview()`
  - `control-loop-guard.ts` — Tool validation, search budget enforcement, re-read detection, architecture scope locking
  - `rewrite-engine.ts` — `selectHighestValueTool()`, `rewriteResponseToSingleTool()`, `logRewriteTelemetryToFile()` for multi-tool response rewriting
  - `project-map.ts` — `generateLightweightProjectMap()` for workspace-aware context generation
  - `verification-runner.ts` — `runWorkspaceVerification()` for automated post-patch build/lint/test verification
- **🛠️ History Tools**: New `history-tools.ts` module with `executeHistoryTool()` — enables the agent to review and manage conversation history programmatically
- **🏭 Mock LLM Infrastructure**: `src/services/providers/__mocks__/mock-llm.ts` providing a configurable mock streaming LLM for reliable integration testing
- **📝 Logger Service**: New `logger-service.ts` for structured, file-based logging across agent modules
- **🧪 Extended Test Suite**:
  - Integration tests (`integration.test.ts`) — full orchestrator loop with mock LLM (168+ lines)
  - Orchestrator unit tests (`orchestrator.test.ts`) — 162+ new test cases
  - Tool unit tests: `browser-tools.test.ts`, `language-tools.test.ts`, `terminal-tools.test.ts` covering file ops, browser navigation, and terminal execution
  - History tools tests (`history-tools.test.ts`) — 62 lines covering history management
  - Context compactor tests — refined with additional edge cases
- **🔬 Walkthrough Auto-Detection**: `detectAndNormalizeWalkthrough()` in `orchestrator.ts` automatically wraps agent responses in `<walkthrough>` tags when the model mentions "walkthrough" or uses completion verbiage with structural formatting (lists, headings)

### Removed
- **🗑️ Artifacts "Open in New Window" Button**: Removed the `artifact-open-in-panel` UI button and its associated `openArtifact` messaging from `sidebar.html`, `08-artifacts.js`, and `sidebar.js` — simplifies the artifacts drawer by dropping the unused VS Code panel opening flow
- **🔇 Failure Detector False-Positive Pattern**: Removed `/doesn'?t (?:exist|appear to be|seem to)/i` from `HELPLESS_PATTERNS` in `failure-detector.ts` — this regex was causing false-positive helplessness escalations when models legitimately described file existence checks

## [0.2.13] - 2025-07-17

### Added
- **🔄 Walkthrough Auto-Detection**: `detectAndNormalizeWalkthrough()` in `orchestrator.ts` automatically wraps agent responses in `<walkthrough>` tags when the model mentions "walkthrough" or uses completion verbiage with structural formatting (lists, headings) — no more missing walkthrough wraps from LLM forgetfulness
- **🧪 Integration Test — Walkthrough Fallback**: New test verifies the auto-wrap logic works end-to-end: when the model outputs "Here is my walkthrough of changes:" without tags, the orchestrator detects it, wraps it, creates the `walkthrough.md` file, and emits `loopComplete: true`
- **🔬 Unit Tests — `detectAndNormalizeWalkthrough`**: 8 new tests covering tag preservation, tool-execution bypass, keyword auto-wrap, preparatory expression avoidance, code-block/blockquote filtering, and casual verb usage filtering (97 test cases added to `orchestrator.test.ts`)

## [0.2.12] - 2025-07-17

### Added
- **🧠 Smart Completion Detection**: `loopComplete` message now carries a `completed` boolean — notification toast and avatar celebration only trigger when the agent emits a `<walkthrough>` (implying genuine completion vs user abort)
- **✂️ Token Truncation Warning**: When generation hits the `max_tokens` limit (configurable via `mirror-vs.maxTokens`, default 8192), a warning message is appended: `⚠️ [Generation truncated: reached maximum output token limit.]` — applied in both streaming and non-streaming API paths
- **🏗️ Orchestrator Modularization**: Decomposed the 2416-line `orchestrator.ts` monolith into focused modules:

- **🧪 Expanded Test Suite**: Added 10 new orchestration tests (`orchestrator.test.ts`), 5 browser tool tests, 6 language tool tests, 9 terminal tool tests, and 1 integration test with mock LLM provider — total test count: 199 tests across 22 test files

### Changed
- **🔍 Smarter Review Editor Reuse**: When the current file is already open in the active editor, the review system no longer re-opens the diff or file editor — it applies decorations to existing visible splits instead
- **♻️ Orchestrator refactoring**: Reduced `orchestrator.ts` from 2416 to 1430 lines (-40%); removed duplicated tool execution blocks, centralized tool name lists, extracted state machine and guard logic

## [0.2.11] - 2025-07-16

### Added
- **🧠 Agent Memory Drawer**: New memory drawer panel with refresh/clear controls, category-based rendering (`convention`, `architecture`, `pattern`, `preference`, `note`), and per-entry deletion — accessible via the new memory icon button in the sidebar header
